========

The [nook2017](https://metanook.de/2017)(Night Of Open Knowledge) was on 2017-11-10.
A german version of the cfp can be found under https://metanook.de/2017/cfp.

I held a talk about single-page applications using React/Redux and related technologies.

I have a project with some example code which can be found at [github.com/runjak/simpleChess](https://github.com/runjak/simpleChess).
